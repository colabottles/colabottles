Hi! I'm Todd Libby. I work for [Knowbility](https://knowbility.org) as an Accessibility and Training Specialist. I am also a Senior Front End Developer and Accessibility Advocate. I do a lot of work in different areas, mainly HTML/CSS/Sass, JS, and I have been doing so for over twenty years as a freelancer.

I live in Maine 🦞 and love to eat lobster rolls, travel 🧳, workout 🏋🏻, walking/hiking 🎒⛰, and going to concerts and listening to music 🥁🎶🎸 among a variety of other things concerning food. 🌯🌮🌶🍱

I am on 🐦 Twitter at [@toddlibby](https://twitter.com/toddlibby) and I am on 👾 [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/toddlibby) live streaming lots of front end stuff. I also run the Front End Nerdery Podcast which you can find on your podcast device of choice, listen at [Front End Nerdery on Anchor](https://anchor.fm/frontendnerdery) and on the 📺 [Front End Nerdery Podcast YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FrontEndNerdery)
