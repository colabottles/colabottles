Hi! I'm Todd Libby. I am a Senior Front End Developer and Accessibility Advocate. I do a lot of work in different areas, mainly HTML/CSS/Sass, JS, and I have been doing so for over twenty years as a freelancer. I am currently learning React, Vue, and Rust. I live in Maine 🦞 and love to eat lobster rolls, travel 🧳, workout 🏋🏻, walking/hiking 🎒⛰, and going to concerts and listening to music 🥁🎶🎸 among a variety of other things concerning food. 🌯🌮🌶🍱

I am on Twitter at @toddlibby and I am on Twitch and doing livestreaming in the future with lots of front end stuff. I am also an advocate for accessibility (a11y). I like to do work on the web, have a passion for things web, but when the time comes, relaxing and resting are key. For more info, don't hesitate to contact me!
