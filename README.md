Hi! I'm Todd. I am a Accessibility Advocate and an Invited Expert at the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).

I live in Phoenix, Arizona now, but I am originally from Portland, Maine 🦞 and love to eat lobster and lobster rolls, travel 🧳, workout 🏋🏻, walking/hiking 🎒⛰, and going to live concerts and music 🥁🎶🎸 among a variety of other things concerning food. 🌯🌮🌶🍱

I am on 𝕏 at [@toddlibby](https://twitter.com/toddlibby) and [@lobstahtodd](https://twitter.com/lobstahtodd) and I live stream gaming and learning over at 👾 [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/toddlibby).
